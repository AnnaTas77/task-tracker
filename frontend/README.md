# ToDo App with Optimistic Rendering

## Overview

This project is a simple ToDo application built with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It features backend integration using Express.js with MongoDB and frontend development with React and Redux.

## Current Functionality

The application currently operates on a pessimistic flow, where user actions trigger calls to the server, and the UI is updated upon receiving responses. While functional, this approach can lead to slower responsiveness and a less seamless user experience.

## Objective

The primary goal of this phase of development is to implement optimistic rendering. This means updating the UI immediately upon user actions, providing instant feedback, while concurrently sending requests to the server to process actions and return responses.

## Goals

1. **Improved User Experience**: Provide users with instant feedback, enhancing the overall experience.
2. **Learning Opportunity**: Gain hands-on experience with MongoDB, Redux, and frontend/backend integration.
3. **Scalability and Performance**: Lay the groundwork for future enhancements and optimizations.

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Implementation**: Update React components to support optimistic rendering.
2. **Redux Integration**: Integrate Redux into the frontend architecture for state management.
3. **Backend Modifications**: Adjust the backend server to handle optimistic requests.
4. **Testing and Iteration**: Thoroughly test the application and iterate on necessary refinements.
